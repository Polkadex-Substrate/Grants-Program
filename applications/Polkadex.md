## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkadex is a Open Source, Decentralized Exchange Platform made using Substrate Blockchain Framework that provides traders with the centralized user experience.

There are many decentralized exchanges/protocols available in the market for traders but they still prefer to use centralized solutions for their convenience and ease of use knowing very well that their funds are at risk. This is because decentralized solutions are still not user friendly to an average trader. Some of them also have no proper decentralization and also got hacked in the process. We cannot call an exchange decentralized if it can lose or freeze customer funds.

The problems faced by decentralized exchanges are:

Inadequate UI/UX experience.
Low liquidity
Lack of advanced trading features, high-frequency trading, and bots.
Lack of proper decentralization and interoperability.
To solve the above problems, our goal is to build a fully decentralized, peer-peer, cryptocurrency exchange for the Defi ecosystem in Substrate. The project envisages the creation of a fully decentralized platform for exchanging tokens in a peer-peer, trustless environment, that enables high-frequency trading, high-liquidity, and lightning-fast transaction speed for supporting Defi applications.

In order to address the first problem, we needed to enable features that attract users into the exchange which includes a fast, responsive UI and trading features. It is mainly to attract day traders and retail investors who prefer centralized exchanges due to convenience and speed of execution. The block time of 3s given by the Babe/Grandpa consensus algorithm allows transaction speeds of up to 400/s under test conditions which is more than sufficient to compete with any centralized solutions in the market today. Please check our analysis here. Since Substrate allows the modular implementation of the consensus algorithm, we think a platform like a Substrate will support the future growth of the exchange by changing consensus to accommodate more transactions per second as better ones emerge.

Secondly, the lack of liquidity is addressed by enabling,

High-frequency trading using feeless transactions.
APIs that enable trading/AMM bots to observe market changes and submit trades.
Advanced trading features like stop limit, market limit, Stop loss, Fill/Kill, Post only, TWAP, etc.
Thirdly, proper decentralization and Interoperability are achieved by having a parachain in Polkadot that brings in liquidity from other blockchains and also using ChainBridge protocol that connects directly to the Ethereum network. Hence, traders have two different mechanisms to bring in liquidity.

The value we provide to the Substrate community is,

They can build custom UI/UX to connect to our network and create their own custom exchange experience.
Traders can contribute their own custom trading algorithms by making use of market data provided by our full nodes.
They get a decentralized trading platform to trade Polkadot & Ethereum tokens.
This will be one of the first Decentralized exchanges to have High-Frequency Trading bot support using APIs directly from full nodes.

We believe that the optimal trading environment is very important for the growth of the crypto industry. Cryptocurrency trading has to be a secure and pleasant experience no matter if you are a novice, professional, retail or institutional trader.

The main idea behind Polkadex was to create a platform that would combine the benefits of centralized and decentralized exchanges into one cutting edge technology. Polkadex caters to any crypto trader. Our users won’t have to compromise on any part of the trading experience.

The goal of Polkadex is to create a fully decentralized platform for exchanging tokens in a peer-to-peer trustless environment, while additionally enabling high-liquidity, lightning-fast transaction speed and advanced trading features such as high-frequency trading and trading bots. Polkadex was bootstrapped by a Web3 Grant at the initial stage of the project to develop the original idea and was accepted as a member of DeFi Alliance.

At Polkadex we believe in the power of DeFi to set people all over the world free financially. That is why we pay great attention to making our platform very accessible and easy to use for crypto newbies. We are lowering entry barriers by focusing on UX and creating interoperable bridges to different liquidity sources including fiat support. Polkadex aims high at being the most convenient platform to buy, store and trade crypto assets.

Polkadex Orderbook is our core product that will also be enhanced by additional functionality. 

The testnet and test orderbook was completed in 2024 early and the Orderbook was open to community trade until Dec 2024. 
The grant is requested to fix all the issues faced during test launch and relaunch the project for live users.

### Project Details

#### Architecture

The architecture and system overview can be found in the following link.

https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/polkadex-docs/blob/master/docs/PolkadexSystemOverview.pdf

#### What makes us different?

Polkadex stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency exchange landscape through its unique combination of features:

- Hybrid Orderbook DEX: Unlike most decentralized exchanges that rely on Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Polkadex utilizes an orderbook system. This allows for advanced trading features like limit orders, stop-loss orders, and the potential for high-frequency trading, mirroring the functionality of centralized exchanges but with the benefits of decentralization.
- Built on Substrate: Leveraging the Substrate blockchain framework provides Polkadex with scalability, interoperability, and the ability to evolve its technology more efficiently. This foundation allows for future integrations and advancements not easily achievable on other blockchain architectures.
- Cross-Chain Capabilities: Polkadex is designed for seamless trading of assets across different blockchains. This addresses the issue of fragmented liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem, allowing users to trade a wider variety of assets in a decentralized manner.
- User Experience Focus: Polkadex aims to bridge the gap between the complexity often associated with DEXs and the user-friendliness of centralized platforms, making decentralized trading more accessible to a broader audience.
- Native Chain Governance: The PDEX token empowers holders with governance rights over the Polkadex protocol, allowing the community to shape the future of the exchange.

In essence, Polkadex strives to offer the speed and advanced trading tools of a centralized exchange with the security, transparency, and self-custody of a decentralized platform, all while facilitating cross-chain asset trading.
